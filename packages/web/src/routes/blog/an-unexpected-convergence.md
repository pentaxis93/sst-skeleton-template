The universality of human experience, as it turns out, is mirrored in the most unexpected ways. I recently found myself deep-diving into computer programming, Western Magick, and shamanism, and the overlap is uncanny.

1. In programming, we structure data and direct the flow of information. The purpose is to manipulate our digital environment to achieve a desired outcome. Similarly, Magick involves the manipulation of symbols to influence the reality we live in.
2. Shamanism is about journeying into non-ordinary realities and connecting with spiritual entities. This can be likened to the concept of programming "servers" - setting up different environments for different tasks.
3. Both Magick and Shamanism require a deep understanding of the systems involved - whether they be metaphysical systems or computer systems. In both, one has to grasp the language and the rules, then bend or push them to their limits to bring about change.

While the real world feels unpredictable, harsh, and overwhelming, we are not helpless. We can shape and respond to it, just like a programmer codes an app or a Shaman interacts with the spirit world.

We're all programmers, magicians, and shamans in our own right, constantly interacting with the systems around us. Let's just get better at it.
