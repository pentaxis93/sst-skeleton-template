## Yo level 2

In a world where science and technology are forging ahead, one might ask where do the ancient practices of shamanism and Western Magick stand?

### Damn this is 3

1. Consider algorithms, the step-by-step procedures to solve problems in programming. Don't they bear a striking resemblance to the rituals in Magick and Shamanic journeys?
2. Magick and Shamanism are essentially about interacting with the world using symbolic representations. What is programming if not another form of symbolic representation?
3. Just as debugging is a critical skill in programming, introspection and self-awareness are crucial in Magick and Shamanism. They help identify and correct errors, whether in code or in personal development.

It's fascinating to realize that while technology is driving us towards the future, it's also bringing us back to the ancient wisdom of the past. The principles of shamanism and Magick are alive and well in the realm of programming.

Instead of viewing these as separate disciplines, we can see them as facets of the same universal truth - a seemingly paradoxical synergy of ancient and modern. Let's embrace this blend and harness it for our benefit.
