Regarding the titular question, I'd better be honest right up front: I have no idea. All phenomena is illusion, and yet it's all so very fucking real. What are we supposed to do with something like that?

We'd better begin with whatever we're bumping into at the moment. I don't know about you, but I seem to be bumping into a lot of stuff:

1. I'm trying to heal from decades of chronic illness.
2. As a result of #1, I'm trying to find my place in the world (again).
3. Crazy stuff keeps happening in the world, and I think it's only going to get crazier. We have to find a way to deal with all the shocking ambushes.
4. In the spirit of James Bond outwitting another supervillan by making use of whatever happens to be available in his immediate surroundings, I decided to learn how to develop web apps (including this website), as a kind of answer to all of the above.

However it goes, more than anything, I wish this to be used for your benefit.
